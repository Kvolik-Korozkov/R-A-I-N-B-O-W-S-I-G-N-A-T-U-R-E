I had fun making dis :)

not useful or anything (maybe just for bragging), just shows a page with an animated svg image displaying my alias which, along with the background, continually changes colors
overengineered enough so both the signature and background colors are complementary colors **and** can handle the use of gradients

prolly there's a more efficient, faster, better optimized and *even* more overengineered version of this out there
